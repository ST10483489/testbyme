This project also addresses accessibility, mobile responsiveness, and seamless user experience, ensuring that potential donors and volunteers can navigate the website intuitively.

Background:
Gift of the Givers Foundation is one of Africa’s largest independent disaster response NGOs, with a proven history of providing humanitarian aid across Africa and globally. Despite its strong impact, the organization’s digital presence requires enhancement to better communicate its work, attract donations, and mobilize volunteers.

Project Objectives:

Redesign the website with modern UX/UI principles, focusing on accessibility, responsiveness, and user engagement.

Present clear, compelling information about the foundation’s initiatives, impact statistics, and donation channels.

## Website goals and objectives 
Increase Awareness: Clearly convey the NGO’s mission, history and impact to build credibility and trust. As one expert note that a non-profit website “must clearly state its mission, purpose, vision and values” and highlight why the work matters. 

Attract Donors: showcase impact and ensure easy giving. Potential donors want to know the organisation mission and the funds that will go towards the project. The site will provide donations options prominently  

Recruit Volunteers: Provide information on volunteer work and simple sign up. Feature stories of volunteer work to inspire engagement. 

Engage Community: offer channels of support to stay connected (website, newspapers and social media). Highlight successes stories and updates to encourage sharing.
