        <blockquote>
            “My son, you will form an organisation. The name will be Waqful Waqifin, and that name is translated into ‘Gift of the Givers.’ You will serve all people of all races, of all religions, of all colours, of all classes, of all political affiliations and of any geographical location. You will serve them unconditionally.” – Sufi Sheikh Muhammed Saffer Effendi al Jerrahi"
        </blockquote>
        <p>Following this message, founder<b>Dr. Imtiaz Sooliman</b>left his medical career and dedicated his life to humanitarian service. Since then, Gift of the Givers has operated in some of the most disaster-struck regions of the world</p>
